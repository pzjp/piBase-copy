The open subset $\mathbb Q{\times}\{0\}$ is homeomorphic to a metrizable space $\mathbb Q$.
Consider $(x,y)\in X$ with $y>0$. Observe that for $\varepsilon< y/\theta$ the neighborhood $N((x,y),\varepsilon)$ is homeomorphic\* to the following subset of $\mathbb R^2$
(hence it is metrizable):
$$\big(B(-y/\theta,\varepsilon){\times}\{y/ \theta\}\big)
\cup \big(\{-y/ \theta\}{\times} B(y/ \theta,\varepsilon)\big)\cup
\big\{(-y/ \theta,y/ \theta)\big\},$$
where $B(x,\varepsilon):=\mathbb Q\cap (x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon)$ (cf. the definition of {S67}).

\* We take the two intervals in $\mathbb Q{\times}\{0\}$ and put perpendicularly, with "intersection" at the center to which we map $(x,y)$. Such map transfers a basis induced from $X$ onto a basis induced from $\mathbb R^2$.
